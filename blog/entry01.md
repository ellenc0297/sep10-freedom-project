# Entry 1: Deciding on what topic I want (Arts)
##### 10/23/23
The topic I decided on my project is arts due to the facts that I have been drawing since I was a kid and have always been passionate about this subject. But I have other choice I got other then arts itself, I even picked fine arts and architecture. **But I decided that choosing the one that I have the strongest skills with will be better** so I deicided that just arts will be the better choice. However, I have to research my topic on how do you do it on my project. For example like from the source of ["Arts and Technology"](https://www.arts.gov/stories/magazine/2012/4/arts-technology#:~:text=From%20the%20printing%20press%20to,landscape%20of%20bookstores%20and%20libraries.) by the National Endownment for the Arts, it shows some concept ideas on how it works. Also, ["Best Drawing Software"](https://www.clipstudio.net/how-to-draw/archives/155465) by Clip Studio, which can also shows some cool apps that I can use if I wanted to do arts on a specific topic (like animation, doodle, professional illustration, manga or comic or even drawing design) that I wanted to do on digital. After I went throught some of those intersting website, but seeing most of the different ways that technology has been implemented in art was truly fascinating to see with my own eyes and some of the different concept for just one topic, made me even more passinate about art, which also brought to my curiosity and wanted to dig more deep into the topic of arts. 

## Engineering Design Process

I am currently in the first stage of the my engineering design process, where my main goal is to try to define the problem. The problem that I hope to solve with my project is that **people are not informed about the world of technology in art**. The next stage is to research the problem and I plan to use not only articles and websites, but to also talk to my peers and those around me to discuss the issue and gain their input on the situation.

## Skills

Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are **time management**, **how to google**, and **communication**. 

#### Time management

I have several commitments outside of school, such as from these examples like picking up my brother and my sister from school every day, and to set times for myself and don't procastinate. But my workload at school is becoming busier, so I needed to make more time for this project as well as my history class. So I decided to go home immediately and start doing my homework immediately, to get help if neccassary. I think this change will change how I moving forward.

#### How to Google

When I Googled _arts technology_ or _technology arts_, obviously I'm not going to look through all 608 million results about arts. But after skimming through the titles and their descriptions was helpful. Instead, seeing titles of articles like [Innovations in Art](https://education.christies.com/news/2019/may/growing-relationship-between-art-technology#:~:text=Innovations%20in%20Art&text=Technology%20has%20made%20art%20far,wider%20and%20more%20diverse%20audience.) was more along the lines of what I wanted to find. Plus, changing my search from _arts technology_ to _arts technology innovations_ also filtered the results down to what I wanted to find, with a lot of the information that I wanted. 

#### Communication

Communication was another important skill I have developed during my time. Since I’m working on this project with another person, it’s important to collaborate and talk to one another. At first, we were doing our own searches and not sharing what we found. But finally we made a collaborative Google Doc where we could compile the links we found interesting as an efficient way to share what we found. We plan to check-in with each other at least once a week about the project, probably on Sunday afternoons or another time when I wanted to.

## Next steps

I look forward to researching the existing innovations in arts! welp maybe...

# Entry 1: Puzzles/Toys
##### 10/23/23

## Why puzzles/toys? and why not contiune arts?

Ummm...the topic that I have chosen for the year-long project is **puzzles/toy**. I chose this topic because I love to study how people make their puzzles step by step or how they make their toys, is just the curiosity that hit you, man.... **PLUS** I am obsessed with the different styles of puzzles and toys and I want to know more about it, especially all kinds of old style ones. There is a Hot-Pot Restaurant in Fort Hamilton, and the design of the restaurant looked awesome. It is one of those kinds of Chinese old style designs. I liked to see how the architecture over there plans these things out and know the process of architecturing and what kinds of technologies they use to do these beautiful architectures. Lastly, my two backup ideas are educational and graphic designs. 

The two main links that I used to explore was [10 Signs That You Should Become an Architect](https://www.mymove.com/home-inspiration/decoration-design-ideas/signs-that-you-should-become-an-architect/#:~:text=Being%20an%20architect%20is%20more,important%2C%20the%20ability%20to%20design.) and [How Technology Is Transforming Architectural Design](https://www.alvarezdiazvillalon.com/how-technology-is-transforming-architectural-design). The first link helps me know what the field architecture is. And the second link tells me what technologies are used in the field of Architecture. Some other links that I had explored were [What Tools Does an Architect Use?](https://work.chron.com/tools-architect-use-10408.html) and [25 Tools and Devices for Architects — Journey of an Architect](https://www.journeyofanarchitect.com/blog/25-tools-and-devices-for-architects). These two were links that helped me understand the intro of architecturing and what were devices/technology that were helpful in architecture. 

## EDP

Now, I am on the (Step 1) defining and the (Step 2) researching step of the EDP (engineering design process). At first, we were defining what we are most passionate about. Then, we do more deep research in the field that we are more passionate about and do more research about the technology that is used in that career. For instance, some technologies that were used in the field of architecture are “3D printers, augmented writing, and virtual reality.” I think I'll be on step 2 for a while before I move on to the next step of brainstorming possible solutions.

## Skills

One skill that I learned during this experience is **How to Google**. I say this because in this part of the project, we were able to use Google and do different research for different technologies in different fields of careers. When I looked up "architecture innovations," I found a lot of cool stuff, but it wasn't necessarily technology. A lot of it was design-related, such as repurposing shipping containers for things like gardens or homes. So I had to add the word "technology" to my search and that really helped me confirm that I'm interested in existing and also future technology of architecture.

Another skill that I also achieved was **How to Read**. After googling, we needed to see which article matches with the topic by reading closely. There were a lot of terms I didn't know, such as "CAD" (which I then Googled, and that ties into my first skill. By the way, it means "computer aided design"). But reading an article is a lot different than reading a novel. A lot of articles have headings and subheadings that break up the text into smaller chunks, making it easier to read. I think that also helps me in the way that I write, for example, I added headings to this blog entry so that hopefully it's easier for you to read!

## Summary

Overall, I'm really excited to make a website about the technology of puzzles/toys. It all started with the inspiration of from my friends!
