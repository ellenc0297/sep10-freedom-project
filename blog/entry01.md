# Entry 1: Deciding on what topic I want (Arts)
##### 10/23/23
The topic I decided on my project is arts due to the facts that I have been drawing since I was a kid and have always been passionate about this subject. But I have other choice I got other then arts itself, I even picked fine arts and architecture. **But I decided that choosing the one that I have the strongest skills with will be better** so I deicided that just arts will be the better choice. However, I have to research my topic on how do you do it on my project. For example like from the source of ["Arts and Technology"](https://www.arts.gov/stories/magazine/2012/4/arts-technology#:~:text=From%20the%20printing%20press%20to,landscape%20of%20bookstores%20and%20libraries.) by the National Endownment for the Arts, it shows some concept ideas on how it works. Also, ["Best Drawing Software"](https://www.clipstudio.net/how-to-draw/archives/155465) by Clip Studio, which can also shows some cool apps that I can use if I wanted to do arts on a specific topic (like animation, doodle, professional illustration, manga or comic or even drawing design) that I wanted to do on digital. After I went throught some of those intersting website, but seeing most of the different ways that technology has been implemented in art was truly fascinating to see with my own eyes and some of the different concept for just one topic, made me even more passinate about art, which also brought to my curiosity and wanted to dig more deep into the topic of arts. 

## Engineering Design Process

I am currently in the first stage of the my engineering design process, where my main goal is to try to define the problem. The problem that I hope to solve with my project is that **people are not informed about the world of technology in art**. The next stage is to research the problem and I plan to use not only articles and websites, but to also talk to my peers and those around me to discuss the issue and gain their input on the situation.

## Skills

Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are **time management**, **how to google**, and **communication**. 

#### Time management

I have several commitments outside of school, such as from these examples like picking up my brother and my sister from school every day, and to set times for myself and don't procastinate. But my workload at school is becoming busier, so I needed to make more time for this project as well as my history class. So I decided to go home immediately and start doing my homework immediately, to get help if neccassary. I think this change will change how I moving forward.

#### How to Google

When I Googled _arts technology_ or _technology arts_, obviously I'm not going to look through all 608 million results about arts. But after skimming through the titles and their descriptions was helpful. Instead, seeing titles of articles like [Innovations in Art](https://education.christies.com/news/2019/may/growing-relationship-between-art-technology#:~:text=Innovations%20in%20Art&text=Technology%20has%20made%20art%20far,wider%20and%20more%20diverse%20audience.) was more along the lines of what I wanted to find. Plus, changing my search from _arts technology_ to _arts technology innovations_ also filtered the results down to what I wanted to find.

#### Communication

Communication was another important skill I have developed during my time. Since I’m working on this project with another person, it’s important to collaborate and talk to one another. At first, we were doing our own searches and not sharing what we found. But finally we made a collaborative Google Doc where we could compile the links we found interesting as an efficient way to share what we found. We plan to check-in with each other at least once a week about the project, probably on Sunday afternoons.

## Next steps

I look forward to researching the existing innovations in visual arts!
