# Entry 1: Deciding on what topic I want (Arts)
##### 10/23/23
The topic I decided on my project is arts due to the facts that I have been drawing since I was a kid and have always been passionate about this subject. But I have other choice I got other then arts itself, I even picked fine arts and architecture. **But I decided that choosing the one that I have the strongest skills with will be better** so I deicided that just arts will be the better choice. However, I have to research my topic on how do you do it on my project. For example like from the source of ["Arts ans Technology"](https://www.arts.gov/stories/magazine/2012/4/arts-technology#:~:text=From%20the%20printing%20press%20to,landscape%20of%20bookstores%20and%20libraries.) by the National Endownment for the Arts, it shows some concept ideas on how it works. Also, ["Best Drawing Software"](https://www.clipstudio.net/how-to-draw/archives/155465) by Clip Studio, which can also shows some cool apps that I can use if I wanted to do arts on a specific topic, that I wanted to do on digital.
