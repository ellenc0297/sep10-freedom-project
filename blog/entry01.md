# Entry 1: Deciding on what topic I want (Arts)
##### 10/23/23
The topic I decided on my project is arts due to the facts that I have been drawing since I was a kid and have always been passionate about this subject. But I have other choice I got other then arts itself, I even picked fine arts and architecture. **But I decided that choosing the one that I have the strongest skills with will be better** so I deicided that just arts will be the better choice. However, I have to research my topic on how do you do it on my project.
