## Context

The info I have gathered regarding the software + hardware technologies that I found in my topic is puzzle related to software and hardware technologies to find further details about my topic, but how did I find details about topic? What sources did I use? The sources I used are usually from googles and some intersting websites that are maybe related to my topic, to give me some ideas and have some further thoughts on my topic. 

## Engineering Design Process

I am currently in the first stage of the my engineering design process, where my main goal is to try to define the and problem. The next stage is to research the problem and I plan to use not only articles and websites, but to also talk to my peers and those around me to discuss the issue and gain their input on the situation.

## Skills

Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are **time management**, **how to google**, and **communication**. 

#### Time management

I have several commitments outside of school, such as from these examples like tutoring some kids and to sometimes set times for myself, like don't procastinate while doing homework. But my workload at school is becoming busier, so I needed to make more time for myself to relax more. So I decided to go home immediately and start doing my homework immediately, and to get help if neccassary. I think this change will change how I moving forward.

#### How to Google (properly?)

When I Googled _puzzles software_ or _hardware puzzles_, obviously I'm not going to look through all millions results about puzzles because some of them are not what I am looking for and some of them are off topic plus not what I am looking for. But after skimming through the titles and their descriptions was helpful. Instead, seeing titles of the webiste from Amazon, like [Rubix Cube Solver](https://www.amazon.com/GAN-Automatic-Artificial-Intelligence-Compatible/dp/B081CWHMNL) was more along the lines of what I wanted to find. Plus, changing my search from _puzzles software_ to _some examples of software puzzles_ also filtered the results down to what I wanted to find, with a lot of the information that I wanted. Sometimes you can use your background knowledges of the topic you are seraching for. 

#### Communication

Communication was another important skill I have developed during my time. Since I’m working on this project with another person, it’s important to collaborate and talk to one another. At first, we were doing our own searches and not sharing what we found. But finally we made a collaborative Google Doc where we could compile the links we found interesting as an efficient way to share what we found. We plan to check-in with each other at least once a week about the project, probably on Sunday afternoons or another time when I wanted to.
