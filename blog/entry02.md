## Content 

The info I have gathered regarding the software + hardware technologies that I found in my topic is puzzle related to software and hardware technologies to find further details about my topic, but how did I find details about topic? What sources did I use? 

## Hardware Technologies
The primary technologies I search for Hardware Technologies is 3D printing and Circut Electricty. People can use 3D print for anything that they wanted to print, for Circut Electricty it can be a toy to help kids do a little creativity with the circut. 

## 3D Printing 


## Electricty Circut 
Electricty Circut can be used for puzzles or toys. It can help kids play around with the circut [Electricty Circut](https://assets.puzzlefactory.com/puzzle/316/621/original.jpg) is shows an example of puzzles of electricty because puzzles are usually about trails and error, which can be good for the kids to play around with.  

## Engineering Design Process

Now, I am currently in the first stage of the my engineering design process, where my main goal is to try to define the and problem. The next stage is to research the problem and I plan to use not only articles and websites, but to also talk to my peers and those around me to discuss the issue and gain their input on the situation.

## Skills

Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are **time management**, **how to google**, and **communication**. 

#### Time management

I have several commitments outside of school, such as from these examples like tutoring some kids and to sometimes set times for myself, like don't procastinate while doing homework. But my workload at school is becoming busier, so I needed to make more time for myself to relax more. So I decided to go home immediately and start doing my homework immediately, and to get help if neccassary. I think this change will change how I moving forward.

#### How to Google (properly?)

When I Googled _puzzles software_ or _hardware puzzles_, obviously I'm not going to look through all millions results about puzzles because some of them are not what I am looking for and some of them are off topic plus not what I am looking for. But after skimming through the titles and their descriptions was helpful. Instead, seeing titles of the webiste from Amazon, like [Rubix Cube Solver](https://www.amazon.com/GAN-Automatic-Artificial-Intelligence-Compatible/dp/B081CWHMNL) was more along the lines of what I wanted to find. Plus, changing my search from _puzzles software_ to _some examples of software puzzles_ also filtered the results down to what I wanted to find, with a lot of the information that I wanted. Sometimes you can use your background knowledges of the topic you are seraching for. 

#### Communication

Communication was another important skill I have developed during my time. Since I’m working on this project with another person, it’s important to collaborate and talk to one another. But, at the same time I had a hard time communicate with my peers because I don't know them at well. But after talking about the same topic with me, we even begin to open up more to each other about our struggles and others stuff. It was a nice improvement and I was proud of myself with that now!
