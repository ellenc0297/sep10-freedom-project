## Possible Future Technologies Ideas

I have brainstromed ideas for any possible future technologies, I thought of some ideas that can be already existed and think of how can be improved even further. These ideas that I brainstrom are from my partner (Qilin), which can help me get ready for us to make a website. 

The bottom are some ideas for the future and what needed to be added on my website!

## Hologram 
Hologram is's a three-dimensional image of the things you wanted to display in front of you (a beam of radiation). I used Hologram as an example that can help improve the society for any toy industries to help costumers see the products in 3D display in front of them, costumer can have a better understanding on what they are looking for. 
* For example, I found this idea from Qilin, but at same time, I wanted to add on a bit further from what I found from [ZiXuan](https://zixuany7791.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) she also gave a hologram examples from her project, so I think it is also good ideas for our project about toys.

## Create your own toys by your own imagination 
The user can put in a headset connected to a machine (3D Printer?)
The headset can transfer what you imaged to be into the machine, and the machine can start generating things that you image to look like
If the user wants to repair and old toy that they broke, the headset will read the user’s memory and the user can decide what period of their life that they wanted their toy to go back to (Time Machine) 
* For example if you start thinking about an image of “a hamster” then it will start making the things that you just thought of as a toy


## Generate your favorite characters making them come alive by AI (toy with smart AI)
The ideas we (me and Qilin) came up with is generating your favorite characters by making them come back alive. So the user can tell the AI to become one of your favorite characters by transforming into them (transfer data with enough information about them). When the AI transform into you favorite character, it can become your toy to play around with (they can become like your lover, family and opponent) to be with. 
* For example, Lars Rorschach, from a love game called “For All Time,” you can tell the AI with enough information to tell the AI to be generated into him. 

## Your life is a (Puzzle) Game! 
From our ideas for the future, we came up with from Qilin's sister: A smart glasses, When the user puts on the smart glasses, the glasses will generate challenges based on the user’s environment, 
* For example, when the user is running to a subway station, the glasses will make it become a running game and generate coins on the way and set the destination to be the subway station. 
The user will need to collect the coins and get to the subway station on time. 
When the user can choose to make what they have gone through when using the smart glasses into a game 
Since different people have different lives, there will be many different puzzle games based on real-life experiences and the users can try out other’s experiences
* For example, when the user puts on their vr, the user will be started with a plot (a plot of a game in a game), which can also allow the user to create their own story, when the user upload the game, other people can experience your story
