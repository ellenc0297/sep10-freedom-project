## Content
The info I have gathered regarding about Aframe, a 3D technologies that I found during my research form the google docs in google classroom, during that research there was a lot of tools I can choose from that, I'm comfortable of from that topic.

## AFrame
Aframe is a generated code from HTML, without having to install anything on your computer from that the HTML can help you generate 3D models, of any 3D models of your choose

## Tinker
Tinker is a code you tru out based on your topic, the one I used is [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/yayovaqemi/edit?html,output) for the after I started using AFrame, this was before I started to use [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/vejubowugi/edit?html,output), the difference was that I changed the color of all shapes, background and I changed the shape of the cylinder to cone, these changes were mostly for fun and play around with to see if the results actually works for me. 

Before: 
``` css
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.5.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#4CC3D9"></a-box>
      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25" color="#EF2D5E"></a-sphere>
      <a-cylinder position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>
      <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
      <a-sky color="#ECECEC"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>
```

After:
``` css
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.2.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#DC23D9"></a-box>
      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25" color="#3F2D5E"></a-sphere>
      <a-cone position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FF665D"></a-cone>
      <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
      <a-sky color="#E1F6FF"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>

```
## Sources
The sources I used for creating this, was the official website of [AFrame](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/), while using this it will show you some examples like the code to use to begin it, I used the code to play around with the HTML to see if the code actually work for me or not. Using trails and error can help me see my mistake, by following the steps, helps me understand what needed to be added or not, which I just slowly play around with the code to see the result and using my prior knowledge of HTML to help create what I got. 

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
Now, I am currently in the first stage of my engineering design process, where my main goal is to try to define my own problem. The next stage is to research the problem and I plan to use not only articles and websites, but to also talk to my partner and those around me to discuss the issue and gain the results that I needed in my current situation, for example like the things that I don't know and need some extra help with.

## Skills

Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are **time management**, **communication** and **brainstroming**. 

#### Time management

I have several commitments outside of school, such as from these examples like tutoring some kids and to sometimes set times for myself, like don't procastinate while doing homework. But my workload at school is becoming busier, so I needed to make more time for myself to relax more. So I decided to go home immediately and start doing my homework, and to get help if neccassary. I think this change will change how I moving forward and how other people will view me. This is still a problem for me because I still have hard time focusing because I sometimes needed help from my peers and friends, but usually I get distracted easily. 

#### Brainstroming 

Brainstroming is another important type of skill, that is needed during this process because using brainstroming can help you what you needed to be put into your process of your topic, by doing that it can help you organized what necessary things that needed to be put at. (basically putting everything together as one) Using this skill can help me improved how I'm going to write to make the wording make more sense and understandable for those who read it.

#### Communication

Communication was another important skill I have developed during my time doing SEP. Since I’m working going to work on this project with another person, for me, it’s very important to collaborate and talk to one another. But, at the same time I had a hard time communicate with my peers because I don't know them at very well. But after talking about the same topic with me that we maybe struggle with, which we even begin to open up more to each other about our struggles and others stuff. It was a nice improvement and I was proud of myself with that now!
