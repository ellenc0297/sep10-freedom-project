## Content
The info I have gathered regarding about Aframe, a 3D technologies that I found during my research form the google docs in google classroom, during that research there was a lot of tools I can choose from that, I'm comfortable of from that topic.

## AFrame
Aframe is a generated code from HTML, without having to install anything on your computer from that the HTML can help you generate 3D models, of any 3D models of your choose

## Tinker
Tinker is a code you tru out based on your topic, the one I used is [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/yayovaqemi/edit?html,output) for the after I started using AFrame, this was before I started to use [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/vejubowugi/edit?html,output), the difference was that I changed the color of all shapes, background and I changed the shape of the cylinder to cone. 

After:
``` css
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.2.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#DC23D9"></a-box>
      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25" color="#3F2D5E"></a-sphere>
      <a-cone position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FF665D"></a-cone>
      <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
      <a-sky color="#E1F6FF"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
