## Content
The info I have gathered regarding about Aframe, a 3D technologies that I found during my research form the google docs in google classroom, during that research there was a lot of tools I can choose from that, I'm comfortable of from that topic.

## AFrame
Aframe is a generated code from HTML, without having to install anything on your computer from that the HTML can help you generate 3D models, of any 3D models of your choose

## Tinker
Tinker is a code you tru out based on your topic, the one I used is [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/yayovaqemi/edit?html,output) for the after I started using AFrame, this was before I started to use [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/vejubowugi/edit?html,output), the difference was that I changed the color of all shapes, background and I changed the shape of the cylinder to cone, these changes were mostly for fun and play around with to see if the results actually works for me. 

Before: 
``` css
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.5.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#4CC3D9"></a-box>
      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25" color="#EF2D5E"></a-sphere>
      <a-cylinder position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>
      <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
      <a-sky color="#ECECEC"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>
```

After:
``` css
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.2.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#DC23D9"></a-box>
      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25" color="#3F2D5E"></a-sphere>
      <a-cone position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FF665D"></a-cone>
      <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
      <a-sky color="#E1F6FF"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>

```
## Sources
The sources I used for creating this, was the official website of [AFrame](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/), while using this it will show you some examples like the code to use to begin it, I used the code to play around with the HTML to see if the code actually work for me or not. Using trails and error can help me see my mistake, by following the steps, helps me understand what needed to be added or not, which I just slowly play around with the code to see the result and using my prior knowledge of HTML to help create what I got.
