# Tinker
Tinker is a code you tru out based on your topic, the one I used is [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/yayovaqemi/edit?html,output) for the after I started using AFrame, this was before I started to use [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/vejubowugi/edit?html,output), the difference was that I changed the color of all shapes, background and I changed the shape of the cylinder to cone.
