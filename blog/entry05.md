## Content
The info I have gathered regarding about my topic "Aframe", a 3D technologies that I found during my research form the google docs in google classroom, during that research there was a lot of tools I can choose from that, I'm comfortable of from that topic. It can help me improve through how much I understand from that research and the information I found, through tinkering it help me what needs to be add and what's not through trails and error

Tinker, is kinda a trails and error stuff, where you can try out your code based on your own topic that you picked,
