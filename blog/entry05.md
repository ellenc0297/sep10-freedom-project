## Content
The info I have gathered regarding about my topic "Aframe", a 3D technologies that I found during my research form the google docs in google classroom, during that research there was a lot of tools I can choose from that, I'm comfortable of from that topic. It can help me improve through how much I understand from that research and the information I found, through tinkering it help me what needs to be add and what's not through trails and error

## AFrame
Aframe is a generated code from HTML, without having to install anything on your computer from that the HTML, it can help you generate 3D models with either with headsets, mobile platforms and on desktop, of any 3D models of your choose

## Tinkering
Tinker, is kinda a trails and error stuff, where you can try out your code based on your own topic that you picked,

The tinkering tool that I used is *Js Bin* I used that to help me see what I can do with the amount of resources I used to try to understand. Then when I finished based on how much I remember from Aframe, I looked at what I changed from the orignial one/ the code that I used to help me understand my topic.

The one on top is the one I tried from tinker (trails and error and see what it can do to help me understand) I used [Aframe for Animation](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/components/animation.html) to help me what I need to tinker and how it works individuality and what it do

## Sources
The sources I used for creating this, was the official website of [AFrame](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) and youtube which I use it in case I don't understand something, while using this it will show you some examples like the code to use to begin it, I used the code to play around with the HTML to see if the code actually work for me or not. Using trails and error can help me see my mistake, by following the steps, helps me understand what needed to be added or not, which I just slowly play around with the code to see the result and using my prior knowledge of HTML to help create what I got.

## Skills

Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned from working on this blog are **time management** and **brainstroming**.

#### Time management

I have several commitments outside of school, such as from these examples like tutoring some kids and to sometimes set times for myself, like don't procastinate while doing homework. But my workload at school is becoming busier, so I needed to make more time for myself to relax more. So I decided to go home immediately and start doing my homework, and to get help if neccassary. I think this change will change how I moving forward and how other people will view me. This is still a problem for me because I still have hard time focusing because I sometimes needed help from my peers and friends, but usually I get distracted easily.

#### Brainstroming

Brainstroming is another important type of skill, that is needed during this process because using brainstroming can help you what you needed to be put into your process of your topic, by doing that it can help you organized what necessary things that needed to be put at. (basically putting everything together as one) Using this skill can help me improved how I'm going to write to make the wording make more sense and understandable for those who read it.
