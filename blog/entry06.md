## Content
In this project for my Freedom Project, I worked with Qilin to make my MVP, our topic is about "Toys and Puzzles" with the bootstraps template that we used for our project, we were gaven the Spring Break to finish this project our MVP. 

## AFrame
Aframe is the topic that I learned, but what is Aframe? Aframe is a generated code from HTML, without having to install anything on your computer from that the HTML, it can help you generate 3D models with either with headsets, mobile platforms and on desktop, of any 3D models of your choose. 

## Challenges & Takeaway 
Some Takeaway I will say is that...
- **Take your time** when making your project, there maybe some error in your code if you rush making you have to find the code
- **Trails and Error** helps when you are including numbers in your code (css) or trying to test out the code if it's to your style

Some Challenges that I have is that...
- **Having some scheduled of your own** I usually remember that I have homework to do, but I usually forget it in the end
- **Contacting each other** since I don't know how to start a conversation with my friends, I usually will be shy on what I want to say to them. But at the same time when we text each other we will be either be busy or available at the specific time that we wanted it to be

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
Now, I am currently in the first stage of my engineering design process, where my main goal is to try to define my own problem. The next stage is to research the problem and I plan to use not only articles and websites, but to also talk to my partner and those around me to discuss the issue and gain the results that I needed in my current situation, for example like the things that I don't know and need some extra help with.

## Sources
The sources I used for creating this, was the official website of [AFrame](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) and youtube which I use it in case I don't understand something about the specific topic that I don't understand, while using this it will show you some examples like the code to use to begin it, I used the code to play around with the HTML to see if the code actually work for me or not. Using trails and error can help me see my mistake, by following the steps, helps me understand what needed to be added or not, which I just slowly play around with the code to see the result and using my prior knowledge of HTML to help create what I got.

## Skills

Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned from working on this blog are **time management** and **brainstroming**.

#### Time management

I have several commitments outside of school, such as from these examples like tutoring some kids and which I sometimes want to set times for myself, like don't procastinate while doing homework. But my workload at school is becoming busier, so I needed to make more time for myself to relax more. So I decided to go home immediately and start doing my homework, and to get help if neccassary. I think this change will change how I moving forward and how other people will view me. This is still a problem for me because I still have hard time focusing because I sometimes needed help from my peers and friends, but usually I get distracted easily.

#### Brainstroming

Brainstroming is another important type of skill, that is needed during this process because using brainstroming can help you what you needed to be put into your process of your topic, by doing that it can help you organized what necessary things that needed to be put at. (basically putting everything together as one) Using this skill can help me improved how I'm going to write to make the wording make more sense and understandable for those who read it.
