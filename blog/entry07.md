# Entry 7
##### 5/29/24

During the elevator pitch and presentation I learned a lot during that time 

## Challenges & Takeaway 
Some Takeaway I will say is that...
- **Take your time** when making your project, there maybe have some error in your code if you start rushing you will suddenly bring error toward your thing you try to do
- *But* for presenting in front of someone you must be preapred on what you wanted to say to your audience 
- **Trails and Error** helps when you wanted to test your code, to see if there is any mistake in your code or if it looks good  on your project 
- **Voices Prejection** Speak louder when you try to speak to people, so the auidence can hear you clearly and loudly.
- **Eye Contact** helps make your project more interesting

Some Challenges that I have is that...
- **Having some scheduled of your own** I usually remember that I have homework to do, but I usually forget it in the end
- **Contacting each other** since I don't know how to start a conversation with my friends, I usually will be shy on what I want to say to them. But at the same time when we text each other we will be either be busy or available at the specific time that we wanted it to be

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
Now, I am currently in the first stage of my engineering design process, where my main goal is to try to define my own problem. The next stage is to research the problem and I plan to use not only articles and websites, but to also talk to my partner and those around me to discuss the issue and gain the results that I needed in my current situation, for example like the things that I don't know and need some extra help with.
## Skills

Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are **time management**, **brainstroming** and **Communication**.

#### Time management

I have several commitments outside of school, such as from these examples like tutoring some kids and which I sometimes want to set times for myself, like don't procastinate while doing homework. But my workload at school is becoming busier, so I needed to make more time for myself to relax more. So I decided to go home immediately and start doing my homework, and to get help if neccassary. I think this change will change how I moving forward and how other people will view me. This is still a problem for me because I still have hard time focusing because I sometimes needed help from my peers and friends, but usually I get distracted easily.

#### Brainstroming

Brainstroming is another important type of skill, that is needed during this process because using brainstroming can help you what you needed to be put into your process of your topic, by doing that it can help you organized what necessary things that needed to be put at. (basically putting everything together as one) Using this skill can help me improved how I'm going to write to make the wording make more sense and understandable for those who read it.

### Communication 

Communication is also another important type of skill to have during SEP. Since I’m working going to work on this project with another person, for me, it’s very important to collaborate and talk to one another. But, at the same time I had a hard time communicate with my peers because I don't know them at very well. But after talking about the same topic with me that we maybe struggle with, which we even begin to open up more to each other about our struggles and others stuff. It was a nice improvement and I was proud of myself with that now! But if it was friends I will have to reach out to them if I needed any help from them to help me understand if I am struggling with something I don't know.
