  * I tried it out with different ideas I can think of, which leads to me creating this
  * Using the infomation from [Aframe](https://aframe.io/) which gives a lot of examples, espically the codes which you can test out
  * I was able create an 3D model using from the link that I have, using that link I was able to learn a lot of new things

3/4/24:
* [Aframe Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cS8uGfd_oG8)
  * From the video I was able to learn some concept about the 3D model, for example watching the video and from the [Aframe](https://aframe.io/) website I get to learn more the code itself and what they do and create based on the video that I watch
  * Using the [Aframe](https://aframe.io/) can help bring you to understand the code like or using the example of the code itself from the webiste
  * Using the website I was able to understand what the code do and able to use it as an example in the future
