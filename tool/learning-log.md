# Tool Learning Log

Tool: AFrame

2/5/24:
* [JS Bin for Aframe](https://jsbin.com/yasapodubi/edit?html,output)
  * I tried it out with different ideas I can think of, which leads to me creating this
  * Using the infomation from [Aframe](https://aframe.io/) which gives a lot of examples, espically the codes which you can test out
  * I was able create an 3D model using from the link that I have, using that link I was able to learn a lot of new things

3/4/24:
* [Aframe Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cS8uGfd_oG8)
  * From the video I was able to learn some concept about the 3D model, for example watching the video and from the [Aframe](https://aframe.io/) website I get to learn more the code itself and what they do and create based on the video that I watch
  * Using the [Aframe](https://aframe.io/) can help bring you to understand the code like or using the example of the code itself from the webiste
  * Using the website I was able to understand what the code do and able to use it as an example for my future project, espcially the freedom project

3/11/24:
* [Aframe](https://aframe.io/)
 * Using the document from the official webiste of Aframe, there was somethings that caught my attentions
 * I found [3D Model](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/models.html) & [Best Pratice!](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/best-practices.html)
 * I learned a lot from the 3D Model document because it talks about how I can create and animate the 3D Model, using those examples from the document.
 * But from the "best pratice" document, it doesn't make any sense to me. But I understand where it was going from the code showing the error people make and the solutions to it, but the code just I don't understand them, that much.
