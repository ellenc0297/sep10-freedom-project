# Tool Learning Log

Tool: AFrame

---

2/5/24:
* [JSbin for Aframe](https://jsbin.com/yasapodubi/edit?html,output)
  * I tried it out with different ideas I can think of, which leads to me creating this
  * Using the infomation from [Aframe](https://aframe.io/) which gives a lot of examples, espically the codes which you can test out
  * I was able create an 3D model using from the link that I have, using that link I was able to learn a lot of new things

3/4/24:
* [Aframe Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cS8uGfd_oG8)
  * From the video I was able to learn some concept about the 3D model, for example watching the video and from the [Aframe](https://aframe.io/) website I get to learn more the code itself and what they do and create based on the video that I watch
  * Using the [Aframe](https://aframe.io/) can help bring you to understand the code like or using the example of the code itself from the webiste
  * Using the website I was able to understand what the code do and able to use it as an example for my future project, espcially the freedom project

3/11/24:
* [Aframe](https://aframe.io/)
  * Using the document from the official webiste of Aframe, there was somethings that caught my attentions
  * I found [3D Model](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/models.html) & [Best Pratice!](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/best-practices.html)
  * I learned a lot from the 3D Model document because it talks about how I can create and animate the 3D Model, using those examples from the document.
  * But from the "best practice" document, it doesn't make any sense to me. But I understand where it was going from the code showing the error people make and the solutions to it, but the code just I don't understand them, that much.

* [Jsbin for Animation](https://jsbin.com/yixitejehi/edit?html,output)
  * When I was tinkering this code into Jsbin I learned a lot during from learning from [Aframe](https://aframe.io/), I learned more about how do animation from a help from my friend who was also doing Aframe.
  * Asking them to explain what animation do help me understand what it do from the code, but some of the code in the document doesn't make sense for me, kinda hard to read.
  * From the infromation given from my friend, my understanding from Animation became understandable, about how it works.

* [Jsbin for Basic Scene](https://jsbin.com/wabibihawa/edit?html,output)
  * When I started tinkering the "Basic Scene" I slowly understand the concept of what "Basic" do and that we should start with the basic before any of the topic, making it very confusing for me. But after looking at the topic for "Basic" I understand the code a bit more. For example, " ``<a-scene>`` in the ``<body>``. ``<a-scene>`` will contain every entity in our scene. ``<a-scene>`` handles all of the setup that is required for 3D: setting up WebGL, the canvas, camera, lights, renderer, render loop as well as out of the box." From reading that I understand the scene a bit better and more. another example, "We can use ``<a-box>`` just like a normal HTML element, defining the tag and using HTML attributes to customize it. Some other examples of primitives that come with A-Frame include ``<a-cylinder>, <a-plane>, or <a-sphere>``. Here we define the color ``<a-box>``, see ``<a-box>â€˜s`` documentation for the more attributes (e.g., width, height, depth)." This shows that using those help you make anything using 3D model either animation or your choice of your own.
  * [Aframe for Basic Scene](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/guides/building-a-basic-scene.html) this is where I get most of my basic infomation from trying to do my Jsbin, using Jsbin I was able to get a better visual of what was going on.
  * I learned how to add text in Aframe!
  * ``<a-entity text="value: Hello, A-Frame!; color: #BBB" position="-0.9 0.2 -3" scale="1.5 1.5 1.5"></a-entity>``
  * Using this code can help me by "adding text" I was able to change what I needed to be put on my model, I was able to get a good visual of what it do and using this information from the document.

4/5/24
* I'm currently learning how to make text on [Aframe for Text](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/components/text.html)
  * I'm confused on how the text appered in front of me. I tried if it was the poistion or the scale but it doesn't work at, but when I ask my friend they said it should work and appered
  * I will see what's wrong with the code or try to ask again or try not to used Js Bin
